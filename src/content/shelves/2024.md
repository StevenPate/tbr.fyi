      notes: 
        content: "Used copies of *A River Runs Through It and Other Stories* appear on the shelf at the store almost magically whenever one is purchased. Every time,  I think \"Is it time for me to read this?\" When I finally answered the call, I want to kick the me that waited so long. Norman Maclean's  semi-autobiographical account of his relationship to a brother he feels powerless to help is absolutely stunning. Maclean's frame for telling the story might be their time spent fly fishing in early 20th century Montana, but the depth expressed is more profound than any fishing hole, literary or otherwise. Told in with the plainspoken, rueful economy of language befitting an inductee of the Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame and written with the impeccable craft of a longtime professor of English at the University of Chicago, here is a timeless book that is somehow also of its time. I am now at high risk of having to read every single word this man wrote. Incredible."

    publisherDescription: "Utterly riveting, Solvej Balle's On the Calculation of Volume (Book I) is the grand opening of her speculative fiction septology, winner of the 2022 Nordic Council Literature Prize (Scandinavia's most important literary award) for being \"a masterpiece of its time.\"\n\nTara Selter, the heroine of On the *Calculation of Volume*, has involuntarily stepped off the train of time: in her world, November 18th repeats itself endlessly. We meet Tara on her 122nd November 18th: she no longer experiences the changes of days, weeks, months, or seasons. She finds herself in a lonely new reality without being able to explain why: how is it that she wakes every morning into the same day, knowing to the exact second when the blackbird will burst into song and when the rain will begin? Will she ever be able to share her new life with her beloved and now chronically befuddled husband? And on top of her profound isolation and confusion, Tara takes in with pain how slight a difference she makes in the world. (As she puts it: \"That's how little the activities of one person matter on the 18th of November.\")"
