        content: "Well-written glimpses into the work of a PNW wildlife biologist working for the National Forest Service are woven into the backdrop of Howell's personal journey. You would be hard-pressed to find a better account of the changing landscape of forests in the last 30 years, especially in the altered landscape of the Northwest Forest Plan's realignment of the forest service's goals, from someone who cares about these places. There is also plenty about specific animals like Olympic marmots, martens, marbled murrelets, spotted and barred owls, salamanders, and fishers, along with accounts from decades at the front lines of forest fires."

        content: "This unrelenting and captivating book peering into the incredible worlds of some of the 20th century's more incredible minds was a surprise and a delight. Whatever sort of thing this is (narrative nonfiction in the vein of Emmanuel Carr√®re? Fiction in a historiographical mode a la W. G. Sebald?), I could not put it down. The author has said the book is \"composed of an essay (which is not chemically pure), two stories that try not to be stories, and a novella\" and allows that it starts more like an essay and grows more fictional as the stories progress. The writing absolutely slaps to the point of seeking out other translations by Adrian Nathan West, and the intricately constructed narratives here are incredibly rich. Stunning."

        content: "Used copies of *A River Runs Through It and Other Stories* appear on the shelf at the store almost magically whenever one is purchased. Every time,  I think \"Is it time for me to read this?\" When I finally answered the call, I want to kick the me that waited so long. Norman Maclean's  semi-autobiographical account of his relationship to a brother he feels powerless to help is absolutely stunning. Maclean's frame for telling the story might be their time spent fly fishing in early 20th century Montana, but the depth expressed is more profound than any fishing hole, literary or otherwise. Told in with the plainspoken, rueful economy of language befitting an inductee of the Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame and written with the impeccable craft of a longtime professor of English at the University of Chicago, here is a timeless book that is somehow also of its time. I am now at high risk of having to read every single word this man wrote. Incredible."

    publisherDescription: "Utterly riveting, Solvej Balle's On the Calculation of Volume (Book I) is the grand opening of her speculative fiction septology, winner of the 2022 Nordic Council Literature Prize (Scandinavia's most important literary award) for being \"a masterpiece of its time.\"\n\nTara Selter, the heroine of On the *Calculation of Volume*, has involuntarily stepped off the train of time: in her world, November 18th repeats itself endlessly. We meet Tara on her 122nd November 18th: she no longer experiences the changes of days, weeks, months, or seasons. She finds herself in a lonely new reality without being able to explain why: how is it that she wakes every morning into the same day, knowing to the exact second when the blackbird will burst into song and when the rain will begin? Will she ever be able to share her new life with her beloved and now chronically befuddled husband? And on top of her profound isolation and confusion, Tara takes in with pain how slight a difference she makes in the world. (As she puts it: \"That's how little the activities of one person matter on the 18th of November.\")"

        content: "Leigh grows up in Rotterdam, raised by an abusive father and a distant mother. She is drawn to the ocean and studies marine ecology and microbiology, and her natural aptitude and luck put her in the right place at the right time to encounter career-making discoveries that connect her work to breakthroughs in space propulsion.\n\nTrying to stay in touch with her sister as their mother develops health problems at the very moment when her career is literally taking off, Leigh struggles to maintain her own perspective, confidence, and their connection as something bigger than her own life seems to be at stake.\n\nIn Ascension is a novel where humankind's deepest questions are explored, from the depths of the ocean to beyond the edge of the solar system, while the lived experiences and emotional life of its main character are kept in the foreground. I loved the writing in this book and the interweaving of its themes using both emotional stakes and scientific understanding."

What is the lure of \"The West\" and does it still endure more than 150 years after it dislodged Swan from a wife and family in Boston for the frontier of the frontier? Ivan Doig was a very talented writer, and I found this very curious book, recounting a year spent devoted to these thoughts while visiting Swan's stomping grounds in Neah Bay, Port Townsend and in between and poring over his voluminous journals in the University of Washington library to be absolutely fascinating. I found the account of his relationship to a Makah chief named Swell and the effect of Swell's murder on"

Breadth of knowledge, humility, confidence and intuition: Yamazaki has the traits neccessary to perform that bookseller's alchemy, where the whole space is the sum of its parts (which is to say, books). He said: \"At a great store you can look at twelve well-selected, serendipitous linear inches and find a universe.\" For true believers only."
